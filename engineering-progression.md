# Software Engineer

*Note*:  Coming in the door, if a software engineer is fresh,
and/or young in his/her career we should assume that these skills are
not necessarily present and that they will need mentoring to develop
the skills outlined below.

## Solution Complexity
* Implement solutions whose complexity are at the scale single blocks of logic (e.g methods, functions, and procedures, queries)
* Implement solutions whose complexity involves integrating an navigating several components within an application.
* Implement additional components that fit into a larger pre-defined structure
* Implement solutions on top of existing or legacy code of afore mentioned complexity
*  Diagnose bugs and implement fixes of nominal complexity
*  Refactor unsustainably implemented code as encountered in the code base
* Demonstrate separation of concerns within their implementation (e.g. functions/methods/procedures, queries, user interface implementations are rarely broken down, with clear blocks of logic)

## Technical Fluency
* Solve problems using essential idioms involving one or two technologies (e.g. core unix tool, sql proficiency, idioms relevant to programming languages, user interface components, web interface components)
* Develop a deeper understanding of one or two technologies beyond superficial usage (e.g. peeking behind the curtain with ruby, rails, query execution, browser rendering, OS and/or platform understanding, etc)
* Recognize the use of software design patterns relevant to your area of focus 
* Iterate and improve upon implementations given feedback
* Triage and diagnose bugs and application issues
* Create tests to capture essential implementation expectations
* Demonstrate understanding of the application lifecycle: considerations for logging, debugging and managing the application in its run-time state.
* Provide design documentation for the scope of implementation without having to implement the full solution first

## Leadership Skills
* Respond well to mentorship
* Contribute to larger projects when playing a supporting role on collaborative initiatives

## Team Skills
* Submit work for peer review and receive constructive feedback
* Participate in reviewing the work of peers and provide constructive feedback
* Demonstrate ownership over the success of applications
* Recognize and communicate need for additional support
* Communicate status on tasks and progress effectively
* Collaborate effectively within your team
* Collaborate effectively with other technical groups within the organization
* Participate in technical discussions

## Typical Years of Experience ##

* 0 - 3 years

--------
# Senior Software Engineer #
In addition to the skills expected of a _Software Engineer_ 

## Solution Complexity
* Implement solutions whose complexity can span an entire application and integrations with other applications.
* Able to translate a problem statement into a well defined application or series of components demonstrating software design best practices.
* Evolve the code base in substantial ways that increase simplicity, enable flexibility or drive new features, while still maintaining good software design principals
* Effective contributor within multiple code bases
* Diagnose bugs that may span multiple applications or services and drive cross application fixes

## Technical Fluency
* Provide constructive technical feedback when reviewing the work of peers 
* Work effectively with technologies adjacent to the their application demonstrating holistic ownership and initiative
* Provide design documentation for the scope of implementation with sufficient thoroughness that the implementation can be handed off to 1-2 other engineers.
* Develop knowledge beyond core competency.
* Proactively make use of software design patterns relevant to your area of focus 
* Navigate and become rapidly productive within unfamiliar code bases
* Rapidly engage with new technologies due to deep, productive exposure several technological tool sets.
* Undaunted when needing to work across multiple technologies.
* Reflexively considers software development best practices and application lifecycle management when developing solutions. (ex. how to test, how to debug, how to monitor, how to assess performance, etc.) 

## Leadership Skills
* Provide mentorship for _Software Engineers_, interns or new hires
* Communicate effectively with non-technical business partners

## Team Skills
* Collaborate effectively with other technical _and non-technical_ groups within the organization
* Initiates technical discussions and frequently shares knowledge and practices within the team
* Regularly contributes and updates team knowledge base regarding the on-going management of systems

## Likely Years of Experience
2 - 5 years
