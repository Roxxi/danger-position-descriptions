# Data Engineering at One King's Lane

One Kings Lane sell products. Seems easy enough. All you need to do is
record what you sell. Oh, right, we probably should be recording where
we're buying the products, and how much we're paying for them
too. Hmm, we probably should track their performance so we're making
sure that we're only selling the best of the best for home
furnishings.  It'd probably also be good if our merchandisers could
tell our vendors which of their products do well, so we can get more
of them.  Ah, and with so many products, it'd be great to help guide
our customers through them with recommendations... and search... and
filtering by attributes... and extracting non-obvious attributes.


The bottom line is: Everyone. Needs. Data. And that's where we come in!

As a member of the data engineering team at One Kings Lane, you'll be
in the business of data fulfillment: making sure data gets to the
people who need it on schedule, and on a platform that will works for
the way they will consume their data.  You'll be working alongside a
passionate and dedicated team.
